Version: 0.9
Author: Josh Nichols (mrblank@gmail.com)
Build Date: 2009-05-24
Requirements: Symphony 2.02 or greater.


[INSTALLATION]

1. Upload the 'color_chooser_field' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Field: Color Chooser", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. You can now add a "Color Chooser" field to your sections.

4. On the entry edit screen, it uses the Farbtastic Color Picker (http://acko.net/dev/farbtastic) to visually select a color and place its hex value into the field.

[TO DO]

Before the official 1.0 release:

1. Add some sort of validation rule so only hex values are allowed to be save in the field.
